## Example Standards Repository

The following files illustrate how to use `stdidx` to index standards files. The `example_standards` directory contains a set of MD files containing coding standards. Each MD file has YAML frontmatter that is used to build the index.

```yaml
---
title: "General Code Standards"
description: "Cross-language general coding standards and best practices."
scope: "*"
tags:
  - general
  - best-practices
  - cross-language
frameworks: []
---
```

These headers are read by `stdidx` and used to build the index. Files without valid frontmatter are simply ignored.

## Example Index Tree

The `standards-tree.yaml` file is generated by `stdidx` and contains the index of all standards files.

```yaml

- path: example_standards/GENERAL.md
